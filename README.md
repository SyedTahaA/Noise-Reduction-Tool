# Noise-Reduction-Tool

### [Test it out!](http://noisy.pythonanywhere.com/)

I made this project while learning about neural networks. I used a simple convolutional neural network to test if it can remove gaussian noise from images.

### Model used:

### Examples:

From dataset:

![](images/Example_1.png)

From google:

![](images/Example_2.png)


Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/duttadebadri/image-classification

Images from the travel and adventure folder were only trained and tested on

### Conclusion:
- Convolutional neural networks are not the best for noise removal
- It appears as if a blurr is just being applied to the inputted image

### TODOS:
  - Improve website design
  - Improve model
  - Find larger dataset
